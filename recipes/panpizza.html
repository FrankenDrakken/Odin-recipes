    <p>The pan pizza is one, if not of the oldest ways of making pizza, it's origins are debated, thought. One tale that gets around is the story Roman Soldiers making pizza using their shields to put a flat bread with toppings, cheese and olive oil on top. Whether or not this story is true, the pan pizza is one of the oldest ways of making pizza.</p>
    <h3>And quite easy to do, too!</h3>

    <p>I made pan pizza as a broke uni student every time my friends came over to study, but without further ado, let's see the recipe!</p>  
    <ul><h2>Primary ingredients</h2>
        <li>Store bought dough</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ul><h2>Toppings</h2>
        <li>Salami</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Diced mushrooms</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p><strong>First things first, you can't make a good pan pizza without olive oil</strong>. So first oil the pan, turn on the heat and leave the pan pre-heating for around 10 minutes</p>
    <p>Next up, add the dough on top and make sure to pop the air bubbles that will form with a fork. Let cook for 10 minutes until it gets a <em>golden brown</em> color.</p>
    <p>Next up, turn the flatbread upside down with the help of a spatula or another pan. Put the tomato sauce, mozzarella, diced mushrooms, salami, oregano and parmesano in this exact order. <strong>It's important to add the toppings fast, so you don't lose too much heat on the bread </strong></p>
